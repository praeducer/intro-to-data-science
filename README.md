Introduction to Data Science
=============================

Join the data revolution. Companies are searching for data scientists. This specialized field demands multiple skills not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Introduce yourself to the basics of data science and leave armed with practical experience extracting value from big data. #uwdatasci

About the Course
----------------
Commerce and research are being transformed by data-driven discovery and prediction. Skills required for data analytics at massive levels – scalable data management on and off the cloud, parallel algorithms, statistical modeling, and proficiency with a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms – span a variety of disciplines and are not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Tour the basic techniques of data science, including both SQL and NoSQL solutions for massive data management (e.g., MapReduce and contemporaries), algorithms for data mining (e.g., clustering and association rule mining), and basic statistical modeling (e.g., linear and non-linear regression).

Course Syllabus
---------------
* Part 0: Introduction

Recommended Background
----------------------
We expect you to have intermediate programming experience and familiarity with databases, roughly equivalent to two college courses.  We will have four programming assignments: two in Python, one in SQL, and one in R. The target audience is students across disciplines who wish to build proficiency working with large datasets and a range of tools to perform predictive analytics.
